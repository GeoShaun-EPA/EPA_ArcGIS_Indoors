# Introduction
[ArcGIS Indoors (AGI)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-indoors/overview) is a floor plan mapping platform from ESRI that brings traditional GIS mapping capabilities indoors. [Hosted on the geosecure platform](https://geosecure.epa.gov), it displays building floor plan data across multiple platforms including desktop, mobile, and web applications.  AGI can be used for wayfinding, room reservation, space planning, and facilities management.  AGI integrates with the current SSO user authentication system so no additional logins are necessary.

The floor plan data in the  current pilot AGI platform has been imported from CAD files.  This is an ongoing process as new ones are imported into AGI.  The CAD files come from local building facility staff in the various regions and programs.  It is often the case that these data are old and out of date as buildings have been modified over time.  Therefore, they require a substantial amount of cleaning during the loading process.  Using ArcGIS Pro, data are both manually and programatically cleaned and imported using tools provided by Esri.  Once imported and published, local users, who are closest to the floor plan data, can use the multi-platform applications provided by AGI to keep the data accurate and up to date.

As the National Geospatial Support Team (NGST) will be responsible for high level integration and maintenance of AGI, the purpose of this document is to aggregate integration and operations information between the various application teams.  Where possible, it will reference existing documents (see links) produced by other staff that have the latest updates instead of reproducing documentation for processes that are quickly evolving as the system is deployed.


## Documentation

**Coordination Guide:** The Coordination guide is a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) (not Jupyter notebook) maintained in a [Github reop](https://github.com/GeoShaun-EPA/ArcGIS-Indoors) on the EPA organization account.  The book consists of markdown files that are automatically compiled into HTML and PDFs when changes are made to the files.  These static files are hosted on Github as a webpage that can be referenced from multiple sites so that only one set of docs is needed.  The source files can be edited through typical Git methods or directly on the Github webpage.

The above html files are embedded in the ArcGIS experience.  To change the text of the ArcGIS experience, simply edit the markdown files in the git repo and after the git actions update the html files, the ArcGIS experience should be updated.
